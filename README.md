# Coding-Quiz

## Description

A fun way to quiz yourself and keep your memory fresh! This application's purpose is simple but can end up having endless amounts of questions, making it extremely replayable and even competitive! Checkout further development for whats to be added to this app in the future!
## User Story

```
AS A programmer
I WANT to challenge my memory on various coding concepts
SO THAT I can maintain my coding knowledge
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a quiz through the application
WHEN I click the start button
THEN I am served my first question
WHEN I answer the question correctly
THEN the screen turns green
WHEN I answer the question incorrectly
THEN the screen turns red
```
## Further Development

* In the future I would like to make the timer function operational and appropriately separated from the question container.
* The timer will count down after the start button is initiated and will decrease if a question is wrong.
* When the timer is up the browser will send an alert letting the user know time is up.
* There will be a scored board input at the end so that the user can record their score and store the information for later reference.
* A scoreboard button will bring up all past scores and initials of those who registered the information.
* More questions can be added to prolong the game.
* The overall design will be cleaned up and the elements will be more bold.

## Installation
