This project is about creating a quiz game. You will need to do the following:

* Have a list of questions for the player. Each question should have at least 4 answers with one being correct. Have at least 2 questions, though more is encouraged!
* When the user clicks the start button, show them the first question.
* As the user answers questions, move them to the next question until all questions are out.
* When no more questions are left, Show the game over screen.
* Add in a timer. The timer should start as soon as the start button is clicked, and tick down each second. It should show in the top right corner of the page.
* When the user choses an incorrect answer, take some time off the timer. How much is up to you.
* When the timer reaches 0, show the game over screen.
* Show the last timer value as the player's score on the game over screen.
* Give the player the ability to enter their initials, then save them to localstorage along with the score from the game over screen. You should save the data in a format that allows multiple high scores to be saved.
* Once the player saves their highscore, show the highscores as a list on the page
* Add a link to the top left corner. When clicked, go directly to the highscore list.
