# Coding-Quiz

## Description

A fun way to quiz yourself and keep your memory fresh! 
## User Story

```
AS A programmer
I WANT to challenge my memory on various coding concepts
SO THAT I can maintain my coding knowledge
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a quiz through the application
WHEN I click the start button
THEN I am served my first question
WHEN I answer the question correctly
THEN the screen turns green
WHEN I answer the question incorrectly
THEN the screen turns red
```
## Further Development

* In the future I would like to make the timer function operational and appropriately separated from the question container.
* The timer will count down after the start button is initiated and will decrease if a question is wrong.
* When the timer is up the browser will send an alert letting the user know time is up.
* There will be a scored board input at the end so that the user can record their score and store the information for later reference.
* A scoreboard button will bring up all past scores and initials of those who registered the information.
* More questions can be added to prolong the game.
